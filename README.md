## World Cup Soccer Statistics
The idea is to create three projects responsible for displaying statistics from the 2018 FIFA Men's World Cup and the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup using the following API: https://worldcup-vua.nullbit.hr (note: if https links don't work, use the http protocol).
The projects are as follows: a Windows Forms application, a Windows Presentation Foundation application, and a data manipulation project called "Data Layer" (Class Library) which is used in both applications.
